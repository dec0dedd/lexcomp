                 Some people argue that a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. I believe it's mostly true to say that, nevertheless I don't think the factors can be organised to least important to most important. First of all, it is very important to eat healthy, because your body needs different kind of nutrients that cannot be find in junk food. ""You are what you eat"", goes the saying. Secondly, it mainly depends on the quality of each factor. What do you call a balanced diet? Does it need to have vegetables and meat, is it opposed to fat and fast foods or does it need a bit of these? Then, factors tend to be correlated with one another. If you have a healthy diet, it's probably because you care about your well-being, than you probably work out and sleep correctly. If these factors are correlated it's hard to say whether one or the other is more important. To conclude, a balanced diet is something subjective, some people may think eating junk food once a week may be fine while others find it way too much. How to measure what impacts your health the most, if all the factors are correlated, it's a tough question and very subjective in my opinion.

                 Both are important in some points of view. An enjoyable job is essential to have a good mood and to motivate you to work everyday at your workstation. Because a monotonous and repetitive job which you dislike may influence your mind and you may suffer from depression. As the sentence says : ""Money doesn't make happiness, but it contributes"". It is also necessary to earn a decent salary in order to not live in insecurity. It allows you to pay the rent or the loads, to buy primary needs and other stuffs. Of course, it depends on your situation. But most of the time, I would say that the money is the first choice due to the nowaday consumerism society.

                 I don't think study abroad should be a compulsory part of education. At first, mainly beacause most of students can't afford to live and study abroad even if they get a little help for it. Even if a student can afford it, he shouldn't be obliged to study abroad, to leave his family behind and to let go some opportunities. So the choice of whether or not study abroad should remain. At last, a lot of students have obligations in their countries and leave them could be damageable. For instance, some of the students are also a parent or they have to manage their studies with a job.

                 The most important factor of a healthy life When confronted to the question of how to lead a healthier life, it is imperative to talk about the diet we choose to impose on our bodies, and the effects we seek to obtain through it. A healthy life is acquired through a series of disciplined habits, eating healthy is only one of those. it would be interesting to ask ourselves what aspect of our health we wish to improve. Whether it is our weight, our cholesterol, our body's acceptance of certain vitamins, the way we eat plays an important role. However, for this purpose, eating a balanced diet must usually be combined with a healthy exercise routine. While exercising, an important amount of toxins is eliminated and our metabolism is accelerated. Thus, it is safe to conclude, that eating a balanced diet is essential to leading a healthier life, but it will achieve better results if accompanied by a daily exercise routine.

The universe of his books is the same in every book except the story and the figures. There are also two cities ( one in France and the other in the United States) and a love story with some mysteries. Sometimes some figures disappear or come out. His books are awazing from the beginning to the end. Guillaume Musso is in the habit of making his figures lovable. He includes at the beginning of every chapter of his books a quote and it is very pleasant to read, that inspire me a lot. He has an unbounded imagination.

                 Everyone would agree on the fact that we have to develop a healthy lifestyle but according to me eating balanced is not always the most important factor. First of all I do think that there is not only one factor of a healthy life. We have to pay attention to many different factors because for example, eating a balanced diet but doing no sport is not a healthy life according to me. The definition of an healthy life is that we live healthy in every aspect of our life and there is not especially a factor that is more essential than the others. In a more personal point of view I tend to thnik that eating whatever you want (in reasonnable limits) is less important than eating just what you need. Furthermore I am convinced that doing sport is also an essential factor because if you eat without thninking to your diet but if you do a lot of sport, you will have a healthier lifestyle than eating properly without any sport. To conclude, I would say that obviously having a balanced diet is a factor of an healthy lifestyle but that's not the most important. I do think that there is not one factor more important than the others but it is a selection of factors that make your life healthy like sports, socializing, having a balanced diet, ...

                 Social networks are certainly gaining an important place in our lives, we are now able to contact our family and friends insanely fast thanks to Facebook ,Twitter allows us to follow people and firms' activities on a daily basis, while Instagram rallies a community of photographs' lovers. Now, how did we react to such big changes over the last decade ? One undeniable fact is that people are now using these networks to stimulate their social life, some people now prefer to chat on the internet instead of going out and get to know their neighbours a little better. We now tend to have a closer relationship with our computer or smartphone than we have with our friends. This accounts for a lot of direct and indirect consequences. Firstly, our body is not quite used to watching a ""blue"" screen all day, hence the need to put down your tablet or smartphone before going to sleep if you don't want to stay awake for a few more hours and be tired the next day which could affect the relationship with your family or colleagues. Second, most people would agree that the internet has affected the way we spend our free time. As a matter of fact, while my grandfather walked two miles to the cinema to watch the latest movie with some friends or played tennis on a sunny afternoon, I find it more easy to download the latest hit or surf on the internet all day. In closing, I would recommend to think about how the internet and the social networks have affected our lives and how we want it to evolve in the next few years.

                 Social networks can impact relationships at different levels. First of all, they can serve as upgraded address books that allow people to remain connected even if life has separated them. Social networks also allow people to stay closer as they can stay away while remaining aware of their friend's whereabouts. On the other hands, social networks might hinder or slow down the creation of new friendships as, when embedded in a new environment, protagonists might decide to stay connected to their 'old' friends and not open up as fast. Also, being connected through social networks might give the false impression of knowing people while what we have access to is only a distilled and strongly editer version of people's lives. Lastly, social networks might be able to create relationships which otherwise would physically not have been possible. For example, a young Australian boy living in the Outback whose passion is astronomy might be able to get in touch with a girl from Iran who dreams to become an astronaut. Overall, social networks reshape our relationships by altering the distances as we know them and creating a new canvas where the world looks much smaller.

                 The balance diert : According to my opinio, there is different factors to take in consideration for a healthy life. However, a blanced diet has a major importance due to its link with others factors. The balance dier has to be considered as one of the most important factor because the alimentation will be linked to the immunity system. A person who had a complex alimentation will not suffer of poorest alimentation diseases. If the person fows a dier, he must take in consideration the content of his food like sugar, fat, proteun etc. to avoid irregularities. By the way, having a balancer diet will help to keep the weight to an acceptable level. If the balanced diet is well done, the person will reach a weight that match with his objectives. Furthermore, the weight will be influence by physical activities that need a good alimentation to be efficient. We can considerer that the balanced diet has a determinant role in the healthy life due to its implication with most of human's activity to keep a healthy life.

                 Some people argue that choosing the path to celebrity doesn't give you anymore the right to claim some privacy for youself. While I partly agree with that point of view, I tend to think every human being deserves the right to keep some decency and share only the things he or she wants. As written in our constitution, everyone should have the right to live his life privately. Nevertheless, some people have chosen to live in the public eye and share their private and most intimate moments with complete strangers. This is a choice they made as responsible adults and there is nothing wrong with it in my view. That being said, we have seen too many times these last years celebrities being exposed on the internet by hackers. These hackers have chosen to share private pictures of these celebrities without their consents and this is  something very wrong which proves once again how much our society has driften away from the value of respect we used to share. Being famous doesn't give you the right to disrespect others, so what right do we have to disrespect well-kwnown people? In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that each person living on this planet should have some basic rights, that includes a right to privacy.

                 If we speak about the Earth environment, and thus, global Earth bad conditions, maybee the first thing to do, internationnaly, from each human to each company (from the smalest to the biggest) is to reduce what we consume. Then, reducing waste would follow directly. That is a imminent necessity, oceans are suffocating. Improving the recycling of every kind of waste (already produced) would be all benefit, for the Nature and also would provide new kind of employment, and at the current state of the world economy, that could also help... Globaly, improve the educationnal system, creating them where they do not exist, where they have disapeared and improve those that need it. We have to realize that our ressources aren't unlimited!

                 I personally think it is more important to have an enjoyable job than to make money. Of course everybody needs money to live but we don't need to live for money. On the other hand, if somebody spends the whole day at work, this has to be pleasant and interesting.  The job itself first and also the colleagues. - Through the job first, you may learn a lot of things, new matters for instance, new ways to work.  By working with foreigners (abroad), it makes you openminded. Working hard may also bring a lot of stress of course - Then if you share your time with nice colleagues, this can help you in case the job is less interesting.  You are still happy when you are going to work. Unfair colleagues cause today of lot of problems (especially psychological ones). The dream should be to have both nice colleagues and interesting job but I think this aim is very difficult to achieve. Unfortunately, there are more and more problems at work and the negative points are taking the upper hand. This was a resume of my opinion concerning this matter.

                 It would be great to change first the vision of environment people have. All day long, we receive dozens of messages that have a negative impact on our mood: pictures of dead delphins or cutten trees produce anger, sadness, incomprehension; documentaries about our way of life (meat industry, for example) produce guilt. I don't believe in negative messages to generate positive actions. The problem is not in the way we treat environment, it's in the way we think it. We must think first about why we feel so separated from environment, then what we want to do with that relationship, and in the end what we want to change or to keep that way.

                 First of all, social networks take a big place in our life. Everyone is confronting all day with smartphone, laptop. So the people don't take time to do simple things with friens. we are all the time in an artificial world. we see in restaurants, bars, all people with their smartphones. So now, the people are not in the real time. Then, Socail networks can combat lonelines. but do we really need 200, 500 or 5.000 friends?  For friendship, this is more than a face on a computer. Bullying is a negative aspect of socail networks. Mallicious people use it to harnass workers, colleagues or class counterparts.Young and old write insultin or hateful messages. But also, each social network has the potential to multiply relationship, delvolp new ones and some find love there. To conclude, social networks have positive and negative points on relationship.

                 This question is very interesting indeed and especially when you are reconsidering your career path, after having been in the same company for many many years. No matter what you do, no matter what you think, you will be always facing this kind of alternative. I worked for 13 years in an international company as an executive assistant and following a reorganization of the top management, I decided to leave the company without having any future professional plan. I was looking for a position where I could bring forward and further develop my key competencies and expertise. I targetted the Belgian market with its different sectors and industries and the salary was not my key priority. After 4 months of job research, I received several proposals and my choice was a well known pharmaceutical company who offered very competitive salaries indeed. This job offer met my expectations and was in line with my competencies and career objectives. I know that I finally made the good choice and killed two birds with one stone: get ride of a previous energy consuming boss and earn more money in a very pleasant job.

                 Yes of course they are ppl after all. The moment you step into a public space you still have a right to privacy and who gets to decide when you are in the public eye and when not?  Being a worldwide known celebrity puts you in the public eye but just being well known in your village even if it's small, still affects your life in similar ways.  It's not up to other ppl to decide if your private life is for consumption and entertainment, that should always be under your own control and stay your own choice. Most times those want to get private information about ppl in the public eye don't have any other motivation for it aside from being bored.

                 According to me social networks have a huge impact on our relationships. Many people nowadays have access to social media and use it to communicate and we can all say that communication is a basic thing for every relationship. Is that bad ? Well, that's complicated. Like everything social networks have positive and negative impacts. Let's start with the positive (yeah, I'm a positive person) ! When I like a person, I always want to talk with that person (logical) and social networks like Facebook make tat so easy because it's totally free and you can chat super easily on lots of devices. You can also share pictures or anything you want so people ave news from you(even if they don't contact you) and that's different from before.

                 My opinion has to be qualified . I think it is important to take care of her/his family and especially the children who do not ask to be put in the spotlight. It is necessary to protect them and not to expose them in front of a camera. For this reason, people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy. (63) On the other hand they have to give legal information if they belong to a political party or have responsibilities at the government level. For example, it is relevant to know their property and if they do not evade the tax. Another point is to be sure they have no problem with law. However this kind of information is normaly private. But public people have to give this private information and the right to privacy is cancelled.(77) It is a delicat subject to define what it must be given or not to the public eyes.

                 Let's first see what privacy still means nowadays, knowing that most people have a mobile phone linked to an e-mail address, have private and professional accounts on social media websites, manage their bank accounts online, as well as their travels and all kinds of other purchases. They probably save all their pictures and films on their laptop, communicate through social medias or relevant apps. Not to say all of this information might be saved in the 'cloud'. Believing that all this very personal information remains private would be rather naive, I guess. We know that it is being sold and used for commercial and marketing purposes - ""If you're not paying for the product, you are the product'. And although all of the above is normally done in full knowledge of the facts, it remains a very personal decision/choice, which is also a right, that should be somehow protected, as many of us are de facto living in the public eye.

                 Nowadays, people, especially women, feel very concerned about their weight while the amount of junk food and the obesity are rising. So when someone, for example a teenage girl, decides to start a diet, she'll more than often will be excessive, thinking that the less you eat, the more you loose is the right way to proceed. Then she'll reach a point when she won't handle her diet and go back to all the unhealthy foods she was avoiding, and it's well known that our world is surrounded by cheap horrible food sellers; fast foods like Mc Donald, Burger King and so one or simply supermarkets encouraging to eat chips, biscuits, candies just by their price. What do i mean? You want to buy some healthy food, like Gluten  free cookies or veggies for example, it's way too expansive for the average population, meanwhile the rest is so cheap that it becomes the best alternative. So no one teach to those girls who feel awful in their body how to proceed and what's the key; I really think teaching how to have a balanced diet should be a priority in education, people should learn that the way to feel good is to eat enough and well, but healthy, and stop watching those unrealistic models we have such as actors, Instagram addicts and others. I suffered of that for a long time and there wasn't anyone to tell me i wasn't looking at things the right way. So again, yes it's really important, for the ones who can't afford healthy food (what should be available to everyone) and for the ones who don't accept themselves the way they are, we need to learn what exactly is a balanced diet.

                 Social networks have grown to become a huge part of our everyday lives and have completely changed the way we interact with people around us. It can be seen that people tend to spend more time speaking with their friends and relatives over the internet than meeting them in real life. Furthermore, social networks are all about speed and instantaneous exchanges. We want everything to be shorter in order to go faster, including our relationships. We are talking to our friends online but at the same time we want the conversation to be over so that we can move on to something else. Online conversations are deprived from the willing of communicate and truly interact with somebody else. In addition to that, time spent together in real life also happens to be polluted by social media. It is common to witness friends seated together although both are staring at their smartphones instead of talking to each other. They are spending their together time alone, focussing on their virtual lives. It can be concluded that social networks have had an impact on our relationships, making them shorter online and making us lonelier in real life.

                 Eco friendly Environnment becomes a big challenge in the last decades. It is known currently that we have to change some of our habits because our way pf living is not sustainable in long-term. A lot of negative effects are expected in some countries in the world. It is very important to have a respectfull behaviour in our daily life. Some pieces of advice will be given to adopt an eco friendly behaviour. First, I think everybody could make something at his own level. People could take public transportations in place of car to make court travels or to go working. It is aso possible to buy food in cooperatives or bio food to avoid some longs travels around the world which are very pollutives. Second, some  little habits have to be changed. For instance, it is better to take showers than baths or to use his washmachine during the night, to switch off the ligts when you leave a place. It is little things that seems to be not usefull or not enough but that could have an effect indeed. Finally, some pieces of advices had been given.

                 In the last decade, there has been considerable debate over the right to privacy. Some people advocate an absolute right to privacy. Other objects it arguing that it is the price to pay when you are a famous person. Whilst I believe that there are strong arguments on both sides, I would suggest that people who live in the public eye deserve some privacy concerning their private life. The relatives of these people should be protected and some informations on their private life shouldn't appeared in the media. Indeed, some people don't choose to be notorious. In my view, everybody should have the right to choose which information can be revealed to the world. With the new technologies, the expansion of the press and the social media, there have been to much abuses in our modern society. It is normal that the justice protects these rights and punishes the ones who revealed information on people without their agreement. In conclusion, although I accept that some information over notorious people are made known to everybody, I feel that we must have first their permission.

                 Privacy is a big issue for everyone nowadays but famous people certrainly have it the roughest due to the fact that they have many fans who want to keep up with their idols. However privacy is something everyone should have a right to, famous or not. It can be both taxing and frustrating for a person to be in the spot light day in and day out, expecially when it comes to pop stars for example. Having to work hard to please the fans and fight for a moment of privacy and relaxation while being hunted down by the paparazzi can be tiring and can sometimes even lead to the artist in question succumbing to depression and turning to drugs. Some time ago a famous Youtube-based entertainer had his cell phone number leaked to the public which resulted in him ceaselessly receiving calls from fans, ending with him having to change his number. The attention that overly obsessed fans pay to stars can sometimes turn into harassment and can have negative effects on their health. The well-being of a person should always be placed first. No matter who you are, you're entitled to your privacy!

                 I tend to think that people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy to a certain extent. In fact, this is their choice to show them as celebrities. Consequently they choose to show a part of their life to the public. As a result, they must not be surprised to be followed by paparazzis who always want to have a good scoop about them. But there are limits on this  celebrity. In fact, everybody has the right to privacy when they want to keep something secret. We can't expose the whole life of somebody without his agreement, only to make money. This is why a part of their life must be private and nobody should negociate whit that. That is a simple rule of respect to the privacy of someone. Seeing as these people choose to be shown to the world, they choose to expose a part of their life. But them and the public must be nice to each other and respect each privacy life.

                 According to my opinion, an enjoyable job is more important than a job that brings more money even if we need money to cope with life. I think that when we are working on an enjoyable job, we are more satisfied with our life when coming back in the evening, we don't worry about lots of points that make induce questioning about the aim of our existence. A job that brings money may surely seem like being more reassuring . But, when someorne executes a job that he has chosen in full awareness and with interest, he seems to be less fed up with his daily obligations. He will execute his duties with a light heart and a good energy. Only this is really satisfying and grateful when he comes home and there is no reason to worry about the usefulness of his existence. Executing ones work wtih  a light heart and pleasure seems far more easy and satisfying, there is no reason to worry about lots of useless questions. This person, that enjoys his job and copes wih everything his job requires, has  a real merit doing everything his job requires. When this person needs more money, he is even able to find a complementary source of incomes because he or she isn't fed up by his or her current job. That may  leave him or her enough energy to cope with a second job after work if there is a need or it.

We spoil it with chemical products and it's a real probleme because that kills entire ecosystem and it's the reason of natural disaster. In a second time we need to take care of our forest because that's the way of breath of the earth! And finally we could limit the use of private transport.

                 To me a healthy lifestyle starts with eating in a healthy, balanced way. It is of utter importance because food is what fuels your body. If you use the wrong fuel for your car, you won't be going very far! It's the first step towards overall well-being and a healthy body. If you eat healthily, you'll feel better and you'll be more inclined to take on physical activities and sports, as you know that your body is ready to make such efforts. But it is also the first step towards overall well-being; as they say, a healthy mind in a healthy body! If you feel good in your body, you'll feel good on a psychological level. And contrarily to popular belief, it is actually quite easy to eat in a healthy but also enjoyable way. Healthy doesn't have to mean boring, tasteless food. You can just go on the internet and find healthy yet tasty alternatives to your everyday dishes. It might also be vegetarian, or even vegan, which is also a good thing since it's a more responsible, eco-friendly way of eating.

                 My opinion is that there are MANY factors responsible for being healthy or not. In order to be healthy one needs to pay close attention to one's life habits: eating well but also getting enough sleep, having regular exercise, drinking enough water and avoiding excessive consumption of coffee, alcohol or tobacco. Being satisfied with your life, especially as concerns the relationship(s) and professional areas, is also extremely important. So I tend to disagree with the above sentence as it tends to give the impression that eating healthily is (almost) enough, while I believe what makes one healthy is the right (and balanced: ""Who lives without folly is not as wise as (s)he thinks"") combination of factors. So if someone has many good habits but does not eat very healthily, that person might well be healthier than someone who eats very healthily but does not sleep enough, is not happy with one's life and generally speaking has a high level of stress.

                 I think the better advice I have to give is ""Be healthy"". Why, because if you stop drinking or eating chimical food, you'll make our environment safer. For example, if you stop to drink soda, the companys will product less plastic which, part of it, finally stays in the oceans and kills fishes and the others. That safes not only our nature but people who can't drink a healthy water because of it too, like some countries in Asia (India,...).Some people in Brazil have to replace theirs habits (to drink water) by buying Coca-Cola because it's less expensif.

                 No I think we could only learn by ourself. For instance, the simple fact that we spend hours on internet which is a lot written in english help us to improve.

Avoid food waste, it's better to prepare less to eat and if at the end of the meal you are always hungry, you can even eat a fruit or dessert.

                 Socials networks have completely changed relationships. The first big impact we could point out is the fact that people stay connected with eachother. Everyone keep now getting news from all their contacts. They can almost get in touch with anyone even if they don't necesseraly know the person they're taltking or chatting to. Relationships  are made easier with new members, it is easier to get new contacts because anyone can talk with somebody on diffrent social networks. I we want to have a conversation with someone at a thousand miles away, it is now possible. We can now almost have an immediate respone to our questions simply by using any social network. Moreover, the developpement of diffrent networks and the advantage of having several networks is that we can sort out our contacts into many social networks like for instance a close friends' network or a colleagues' social network. Unfortunately, the rising of social networks have not only induced good effects. Indeed, social networks have made real human contacts less frequent since it is now possible to be connected without being in front of each other. People tend now to chat online instead of go visiting their friends of contacts. They prefer now the internet to communicate rather than have a face to face conversation. As a result, people tend to stay at home and don't go see their good or old friends anymore, they just keep in thouch via social networks.

                 As I've seen in the movie ""Demain"", there are a lot of answers to this question. To name a few, people could grow some crops in dedicated areas in our towns in which everyone could help but also take what they need. After that, our Governments could improve renewables energies, make sure that factories don't exceed polution's limits or develop a better management of our bins.

                 Yes they have. If I were a ""star"" I would enjoy to meet my fans , to shake hands, to hear how fond they are of   marvellous myself. Just for a short time though, as I would soon get bored to find reporters paparazzis or  excited girls ( this being questionnable... )  ) in my sleepingroom or elsewhere in my house. The main problem for such people is how to preserve their privacy should they  want to . Public eye implies public appearance . A  so-called star is not much by itself, it needs a manager , a financial advisor a marketing staff, just name them. Main point for me is Morality . How to keep a balanced life among the ones who are making a living thanks to me , how to sort the good ones from the others needs a sharp and permanent  control of their job. To keep in mind  some ,perhaps many , are jealous and wish me the worst could help not  to fall  into what  they want me to. This a rather pessimistic comment so far. Politicians, artists, stars are  used to meet  or ought to learn how to cope with ""the publc eye"" .

                 Social Media are made to bring people closer. MySpace, MSN Messenger at the time, Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp today were all designed to share your daily life and passions with your friends, fictional or not. But fifteen years after the upcoming of these networks, one has to admit: these actually brought us appart. In a couple, rare are those who don't go to sleep with their smartphone, while their loved ones are lying down next to them, doing the same routine. Checking facebook, browsing on Twitter, liking on Instagram (Google+ is just irrelevant). Those ritual moves are killing daily relationships and give the false impression to be closer of your so-called friends.So here is my opinion: social networks are the new opium of the people, as they tear people appart while giving the impression to be closer of fake, unreliable friends. People should care about their direct circle, spouse/husband, kids, friends, enjoying little moments for themselves instead of thinking of a good filter to pimp up their photographs. In a couple of month, I'll be leaving Belgium for the other end of the planet. Literally. And for quite a while. Since I announced my trip to my family, good friends and colleagues, I came to realize that the time I spend with them is a thousand time more precious than the lost minutes I spent on Social Media. I really stroke me, lately. How I can lose time checking the fake, staged life of people I barely know on Facebook or the storms in a teacup happening on Twitter... I'd be better off my smarthphone and good wifi in the outback, I'm sure of that.

                 There are two different possible effect. Some people will say that it brings people together. Indeed, thanks to forums and social medias you can be in touch with people who live far for your home and who share the same tastes as you, the same passions. Without the Internet, you would never have met them. Other people will say that social networks tears peoples appart. Instead of meeting people of your town, some people keep playing on your computer. They miss a big part of their life. The real life is much more important than the virtual one. True relationships only happen in teh real life, when you can see and feel the other person and create a real link. In my opignion, the Internet has bring us a lot of advantages but we should not forget the true life goals. Family, close friends are the most important things in our life and it would be too sad to reduce the moment of hapiness we share.

I decided to improve my english and I explained to her that she needed to go back inside and then turn left.

With issue of global warming, there are some solutions we can bring. Firslty, humans need to change thier mentality about the environment. We have to be more closer of nature. It is mean, respect nature, environmental friendly. Indeed, the polution by humain beings is relevant issue. For instance, if person avoid to use their car very frequently it would be better for the atmosphere. Secondly, the industries is one of actors which could contribute to resolve of this issue. We are living in consumption society and the companies are main actors. Their supply chains or productions need to be improve for respect the environment. For instance, the companies need to share with others industries the innovation in sustainable ressources or practices. Thirdly, there is a straighforward solution against capitalism. The capitalism and the economy in worldwide seems to be unefficient. This situation are caused many problems. Maybe, we need to change the entire mentality. It is mean, think about other way of living. For instance, this solution would mean stop mechanism of capitalism and the current economy.

                 The most important factor of a healthy life When confronted to the question of how to lead a healthier life, it is imperative to talk about the diet we choose to impose on our bodies, and the effects we seek to obtain through it. A healthy life is acquired through a series of disciplined habits, eating healthy is only one of those. it would be interesting to ask ourselves what aspect of our health we wish to improve. Whether it is our weight, our cholesterol, our body's acceptance of certain vitamins, the way we eat plays an important role. However, for this purpose, eating a balanced diet must usually be combined with a healthy exercise routine. While exercising, an important amount of toxins is eliminated and our metabolism is accelerated. Thus, it is safe to conclude, that eating a balanced diet is essential to leading a healthier life, but it will achieve better results if accompanied by a daily exercise routine.

                 Do social networks have an impact on relationships? Yes, they do. Another question would be to define the kind of relationships which are affected. According to me social networks can either damage relationships or make them feel more real than they actually are. Let's take Facebook as an illustration. If you count your ""friends"", you will be quite surprised about the number you reach. Some questions may be raised after doing this: are they all really my friends? would I invite them to my birthday (personally, the result was 53 people out of 181 contacts), would I talk to them on a daily basis/if I met them in the street/if there wasn't that particular common friend? I can therefore say that a lot of relationships are way more than they actually are thanks to, or because of, social networks. In terms of damaging relationships, social networks can be of advantage to two sorts of people; sneaky ones and inferiority complex-sufferers. For the former, let's say that privacy is not the strong point of that kind of media. You can see everything people allow you to see and you can even know when someone ignores you (thanks to the wicked ""seen"" indactor). For the latter, you only have to listen to the news to see the number of youngsters that commit suicides after being bullied on social networks. Before bullying was the matter of school: children intimidating others and so on. Nowadays, pupils take this back at home when school is over. The only place where they felt safe is now invaded by their everyday problem, which leads, inevitably, to drastic results. I guess social networks are not the best thing that happened in our era. However they offer the advantage of being fast (e.g. to reach a ""friend"") and convenient (e.g. to share pictures).

                 The world where we are isn't very good in matters of environment. There are pollution, radiation, we destroy forest and nature. By this way we also kill himanity. My first advice is to think about what we do with the environment. Is that good? Bad? What can we change? How can we change? We need to be conscient that we need to change our lifestyle. My second advice is to promote good for the nature lifestyle models and projects that can change our exploitation of our panet. Everyone can do that in its little level, but when you do something, it is already a little step foward. It can seem like a drop in the bucket, but little rivers make big flowding!

                 It's sure that having a healthy diet helps to have a healthy life. But for me it's not the most important factor. The way of life is the most important factor. Don't smoking and don't drinking for example are some factors whose help to be healthy. Sport is also very important. I think that you can eat what you want if you practice often sport. Giving a big importance to eating is not the solution. For me, everything is in the head. If you decide to have a healthy life, you have to practice a lot of sports and pay attention to every excess that you can make. Of course if you go very often to the fast food you won't have a healthy life but you have to find a kind of golden mean. As I said it's not the most important factor but it's still a factor. So my point of view is that sport is the most important factor for a healthy life and a balanced diet shouldn't have a lot of importance if you don't fall in the excess.

                 Nowadays, thanks to the many progresses in the medecine sector, people are far more aware that their health is highly linked with what they eat. First of all, eating a balanced diet protects you from many kinds of disease, such as heart attack or many sort of cancers. Fruits and vegetables are well known for their curative power, and the protection they offer against the aforementionned diseases. Take for instance brocolis : people who eat brocolis at least once a week are likely to have a longer life and are   immuned against some cancers. Moreover, some food, like fish, are said to make people more clever, and more able to think, calculate and work. A person who eats fish regularly will see his skills increase considerably, he will be more able to produce an efficient and reliable work. Finally, people are more enthusiastic and dynamic to practise sport when they are healthy, and to be healthy they need to eat a balanced diet. It is therefore like a vertuous circle, and people will feel more confortable with their body. To conclude, the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that people's health is clearly related with what they eat. It is really important to be cautious with what you eat, as some food have detrimental effects on yourself, whereas others can make you live longer.

My point of view is that when you don't feel good at work, you don't feel good in life. A lot of companies don't care about how their employees feel at work. They only think about making profit instead of caring about people. The worst is that some people become depressive because of their work. And being depressive can lead to suicide.

                 There is a belief according which a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. Personally, I do not think it is THE most important factor for for a healthy life, but it appears to me that it is a key factor. Firstly, I think that healthy diet is paramount for life hygiene because you it keeps you fit and provides you the right amount of energy for your daily activities. It prevents your body from nutritional shortage and from feeling drained. Also, considering the fact that it includes eating biological food without loads of pesticides and preservative chemicals, it has also a great impact to eat healthy to avoid such harmful products. It is not anymore necessary to prove that they weaken the human body and can cause cancers or other serious illnesses, although the European legislation sometimes does not prohibit them because they make deals with chemical corporations. However, I am convinced that a balanced diet alone is not enough to guarantee a healthy life. I do believe that a physical training is also essential. According to me, these two elements have to be gathered to pretend to a healthy life, but not only one of them. For example, if you eat in a balanced way but you never do any physical exercise, of the opposite ; if you do a lot a sport but you eat fatty dishes at every meal of the day, you will not have a good life hygiene. As a conclusion, I would rather say that BOTH healthy food and regular physical exercise combined are needed to have a healthy life. They are both paramount but that is why I would not claim with certitude that balanced diet is THE most important factor for such thing.

                 Social networks tends to create a distance between people, but paradoxally it is also a very good way to keep in touch with friends and family abroad. I would say that the impact of social network on relationship depend very much on how it is used, that comment is true for most of the new communication technology that are spreading nowadays. Considering social network as facebook or instagram, the impact on people's life can be quite important. For the persons who are particularly influencable (such as teenagers for example) seeing too many images of the same kind (thin models, beautiful holiday pictures,...) that reflect a life that is, most of the time, only superficial and unrealistic can be devastating on their self-esteem and the value they give to their lifes. Adults are of course also concern by this impact, especially those who are already experimenting trouble such as depression and self-depreciation. On the other hand, social networks are an efficient media for communication, it allows to share things that we would have never shared before, andto anyone arround the globe. The respect of personal privacy is actually an other issue that can be pointed out when we take social networks in consideration, but that fact has less todo with the impact it can have on relationships.

                 I totally agree with that concept. In your life everything as to be balanced. Who said that a good burger was not a delicious thing when you're super hungry after a busy day? Who said you can't eat sweets, candies, ice creams, pastries when you just want to? All those things definitely aren't forbidden to eat, but people need to realize they have to do it with balance. Burger? Yes, but not everyday. Ice cream? Once a week maybe. Balance what your body needs or not. Take a little of the things that are ""not so good"", and thye won't affect your body that much. Just as the well-known ""diet food"", such as salads, fruits, veggies... They are good for your body of course, but not if you eat them in big quantities. Eating only fruits and vegetables just because you want a flat belly doesn't make sense: your body is not used and acclimated to eating one type of aliment. You should diverse what you eat. They key to a healthy life is eating everything, from junkfood to diet and light food; but eating a little bit of each of them.

                 I totally agree with this sentence. In fact, if you want to be fit, a balanced diet is more important than doing sport only. But being fit is not the only purpose in life. A good diet keeps you in shape, lively, awake... It brings you everything you need ( vitamins, calcium, ... ) and keeps away illness. It's ok to eat some fast food from time to time but it mustn't be a habit. Of course you have to drink a lot of water too, it's the only liquid you need to survive. It's important to avoid sodas and you need to control your alcohol comsumption. Having a balanced diet for me is to eat everything, to vary your meals, to eat a lot of vegetables, and if you can buy local products it's even better. I think that today the 'bad' food is a lot more affordable than healthy food and it's a big problem in our society. We need to change the way we buy food for us and for the planet.

                 According to my experiences I would say that having an enjoyable job is really more important that having a boring one with a high salary. It makes more sense to work for a company and projects that fit with our values and to evolve in a friendly environment. But, obviously, the salary we get must cover the expenses related to our livelihood. Probably the best option would be to find a job that we like, that is well payed and contributes to improve the society (in terms of sustainable development for example).

Now, we can easily get in contact with anybody, anywhere, at any time. Nowadays, social networks are everywhere. We can share every single moment of our life and communicate with the entire world. However, by using this kind of social networks, people are creating a virtual world. They stay alone, behind a screen and there are always interrupted with notifications. Moreover, we are humains and interactions are very important for our development. The internet breaks real interactions and brings people in a virtual world, a world of illusion, a world with no mercy, a ""fake"" world. Indeed most people do not make any distinction between the real world and the virtual one. To conclude, social networks change our way of thinking, our way of living. We have to stay as human as possible and keep real interaction alive. There is much more to learn about the real world.

                 I think the most important is to have an enjoyable job because the laps of time between the beginning of your carreer and your retirement is very long nowadays, and will grow in the future. So, you will have to manage all your life with a crappy stressful job. Of course, a few people will say that the money you earn will help you with all your problems, but I think an entire life based on money and nothing else is not really a life, there are more honorable values in our world. Finally, an enjoyable job where you're good at it will ensure a good carreer. In other words, you will begin low but maybe finish at the top.

                 First, it's important to modify our behaviour when we have to move ! Nowadays, the car is the easier mode of locomotion but this is not the best. Public transports are a good solution. The problem is that these public transports aren't well organized. When you want to go to a big city, you can note that there are not enough parkings near the stations, the underground, then you go further with your car... And another problem of public transports is the lack of fiability, the failure to respect timetables, they are too often late so the people are discouraged and they return to their cars... Another point that could be improved is the household waste. When we go to the supermarket, too much products are packed with plastic. Before, paper was used to pack goods and paper is recycable, that's a better solution, it's the same with the bottles, too much are also in plastic material and that's difficult to recycle.

                 For a long time, people did not pay attention at what they were eating. As a consequence, the life expectancy used to be much lower than it is today. I believe that a balanced and diversified diet can actively contribute to a healthy life. Moreover, failing to do so can deteriorate the health at an increasing rythm. However, it is not the only factor of that importance that support that goal. First of all, all scientists agree with the fact that only a diversified diet bring all the essential nurtients that our body craves. On the contrary, a diet based on only two or three dishes - as we can think of the one of fast-food lovers - only bring the same nutrients without filling in for the rest of it. In that spirit, we can easily understand why is a balanced diet good for your health. If your body adequatly have all the nutritional elements that it needs to function perfectly, it will wear down much slower than it would have if it did not and you will feel in better shape. Nevertheless, we need to amend slightly the previous claim. Indeed, if the diversity and quality of the meals are important for the health, we do not have to loose of sight the fact that quantity is a big factor as well. We do not have to abuse of the good recipe. Instead, we must use it with wise and moderation. As far as its importance is concerned, I think that they are, unfortunately, more factors to take into account. Indeed, we cannot diminish the importance that sport, smoking habits or even calm and peace of mind for example have on our overall health and on our life expectancy. To sum it up, I would say that a balanced diet might be the starting point of a healthy life but it must be joined by other habits as well as avoiding the degrading ones such as smoking or drinking.

                 As far as I am concerned, I indeed think that studying abroad should be a compulsory part of education. However when I say ""education"", I mean higher school or university. Whatever three or five years, every student should spend at least six months abroad. First and foremost, from a personal point of view, it allows the student to be out of his confort zone which is a essential step in every life. It forces the youth to discover another culture, sometimes even another language, enabling him to come back in his country more open-minded, critical, aware of what happening outside of his borders. From a educational point of view, it makes possible for the student to be conscious about another way of studying. With regard to my experience, I made my university exchange in Peru. There the system was quite different than the Belgian one. Whereas Belgian universities don't give students an ongoing work, the Peruvian requirements were higher along the whole year. I had to work every week which enables me to be ready for the exams whitout being forced to study a lot the week before. For those reasons, studying abroad should be compulsory for everyone as long as it makes you happier.

                 It is very difficult to determin which book is the best I have ever read because I have read many and many and I am still doing it. However, after a few minutes of thinking, I would say the Harry Potter books. First, they helped me love reading when I was a little girl. Indeed, my father ""almost"" ordered me to read at least one or two chapters everyday in order to improve my reading speed, my vocabulary and so on and so forth. When I finished the third one, I was completely in love with the books and it gave me the desire to pick up another one. Today, I have at least a hundred books at home. Second, they are my first saga so they are more precious to me than could be The Chronicles of Narnia or even The - So Precious- Lord of the Rings. Finally, we can not deny that JKR made an enormous work given that she created a world from A to Z: the characters, the places, some of the creatures, the spells, .... Her whole magic world has had a huge impact on our own one because we are using her specific vocabulary in the daily life. For instance, someone is saying to be a muggle when he or her is lacking particular skills. In conclusion, the Harry Potter books are definitely one of the best books I have ever read.

                 Privacy is indeed a right. The reasons why someone may be in the public eye are varied, but they should be the only things we are allowed to know. If you are an actor, a politician, a musician or a writer you already give yourself to the eye of the society. The public is the way they earn their lives, but that doesn't mean they are parasites and therefore that we have the right to penetrate their intimacy. They have agreed to share a bit of themselves but that bit should only be what they feel comfortable about and shouldn't be much more than what they are doing for instance a musician can talk about something personnal to explain a song or a politician can explain why a subject is close to his heart,and that should be it. People who are thirsty of more and more about personnal business of others are broken inside,unsatisfied about their lives and they need to fulfill  their daily routine with drama or they like to feel clever when watching dumb and spoilt people in their own little meaningless lives. Thus, privacy is a right but not every person in the public eye wants it, some people just want to be rich and famous and will show no mercy to their integrity and because of those people, others have to go through unnecessary awkward and though situations to keep their lives out of the eyes. At the time of social media, the lack of privacy touches everyone, we do not know the boundaries of it anymore, so if you already know everything about your best friend's cousin then why is it so wrong to know all about this famous person that knowingly put himself in the public eye? On the other hand, I do think that being famous is also having to be honest and respectful. So if something happens and has a pubic impact on your work, you have to explain a little bit of it. But yet again, details are not needed. In conclusion, privacy is a right and the lack of it as well, what's mostly important is what the person wants, but it is well known that when giving a little bit, people always want more. Accordingly, people who live in the public eye will always have to put their private life a little bit in the light with them, but they should never have to show more than needed or beyond their comfortable limits ",0.6333333333333333,64.58,7.35,8.25,45.5,414.0,13.0,558.0,26.0,31.846153846153847,1.3478260869565217,0.4452380952380952,9.124665682068786,6.452112979851012,60.526208026208025

                 In my opinion, traveling abroad is the best way to learn a language. First of all, it's incredibly faster than in your own country because you have to speak non-stop in the other language. Moreover, speaking with native speakers increase your listening and speaking skills in a real conditions of living. For exemple, I went to Canada during 4 months and I learnt more than what I studied while I was at school in Belgium. So yes, if we want to increase the number of multilanguals people in Belgium, studying abroad must be a compulsory part of education.

                 Some people argue that celebrities don't have a right to privacy but I am not sure that is the only part of the question and the right answer. First thanks to the social medias and the globalization people tend to think that they can speak and write whatever they want to some people, especially to the known people. They argue that it's the freedom of speech but I'm convinced that celebrities have the right to the respect. When you are a celebrity, this is difficult to keep your life private but the other people have to respect your decision, if not, it's a kind of harassment. On the other hand, when you live in the public eye, the population has a eye of what you do and can make comment and judge you but in accordance to the respect I think. I'm totally against paparazzi who doesn't respect anything. To sum up, if there are rules for the privacy and if people understand the importance of respect, I think that there are no problem to manage both side of the celebrities.

                 Social networks are present for even everybody in our civlization and particulary for people between 14 and 35 year old. Social networks have consequences in different ways and one of the most important way is the relationships. This is what I will speak about. Firstly, a relationship is something that people live differently. Some people juste like to have very good friends and others like having a huge range of friends. According to me, social networks have an impact for both kind of people and have controversed impacts. It allows people to be all the time connected with their friends even with friends that we can not see everyday! And you can take care of your really good friends everyday. Moreover, with social networks, contacts are easier and that helps some people to have relationships. In fact, it isn't easy for everybody to make friends and sometimes it's easier to start chatching behind a computer. This is a good impact of social networks but these people don't have to forget to see their friends, to have real activities and not be all the time behind the computer. However, with social networks, people are all the time connected. The can even never juste make a break at the end of the day and just forget their problems. Problems follows people in their house, in their bed in all their live. I think that this is a big consequence for jonger people. Somethimes things don't happend goodly at school or with their friend and it follows them everywhere. To conclude, social networks bring a lot in relationship for people. It allows them to have friends and to be connected. But being continually connected has sometimes bad consequences and can make people unhappy by bringing their problems at home. We absolutly have to be carefully with social networks and to use it in a right and good way that makes us feel good.

I love reading this book because the writer talks of a new, magic world which a lot of character and also a lot of moral basis, like friendship, relationship, happiness and the fight between the good and the evil's character. I started reading these books when I was very young, around 11 years old, when the first book had been published. One years later J. K. Rowling, the writer, decided to transform her immaginatory's books into film's saga. And I started to go further with the books and the film together because I love finding another place from reality and improving my immagination, but also because everyone at that time was reading that.

                 It seems to be rather obvious that social networks have become a key aspect of today's society, specially among millenials. Teenagers all over the world have started sharing their personal live's on these internet spaces at a suprisingly rapid pace, something that has proven itself to be a dramatic change on the way they interact with each other. However, what could this possibly imply? An increasing attachment to electronic devices and the need to instantly show your internet network the latest news could result in fewer real life interactions with the people around them. Relationships are all of a sudden no longer based on trust or mutual interests, but rather on who's got the most ""online friends"" or ""followers""; It is all about demonstrating how good your life is in order to make other people envy you or be miserable, since they feel they could never have the same amazing experiences. Despite these worrying aspects, social networks are also a way of giving social introverts a way to reach out to people, proving themselves as useful tools, not only for them but also for people who would have never met otherwise. Overall, social networks have got both good and bad qualities, it all comes down to the use that it's made of them.

                 Any people agree with this question but as I'm concerned, i don't think so. Studying abroad can be beneficial for our language level or to improve our ability to adapt a new milieu. But I tend that it mustn't be compulsory. Most of the people needn't to learn foreign language for their future job. Furthermore, I would argue that any people don't want to leave their friend, their family and their university to study in a foreign country. It's also possible that the study level is better in their country than abroad, therefore it isn't interesting to leave. Taking everything into consideration, i don't say that studying abroad is harmful. On the contrary, I'm convinced that it can be a great experience but I tend to think that it shouldn't be a compulsory part of education.

                 Over the last few years, there has been growing concern about environmental issues. The challenges we are now facing offer unprecedented opportunities to move towards sustainable development. The easiest way to lower our ecological footprint is the selective sorting of waste. This doesn't take more time than using a general dustbin while it permits a more optimal recycling. On the other hand, as students in Belgium, we have access to intensive public transportation. Moreover, this user-friendly environment is cheaper than using your own car and contributes to global CO2 reduction.

                 Nowadays, more and more people tend to think that the internet and social networks are a good way to socialize and meet new people.  However, in my opinion the social networks isolate people who use it. It is generally accepted that when you use the internet or social networks, you can easily meet people and speak a lot with them.  Nevertheless, I think that is fake.  In front of your computer you can't see the emotion that your friends have on their face.  The better way to socialize and to talk to people is in a bar, your sport club or other activities.  For instance, when you have a hassle with a friend it's better to talk face to face.  Indeed, on your computer you have the time to think what you'll respond.  Face to face you have to react directcly I find it better. Moreover, I would argue that social networks and the internet can be very dangerous.  Indeed, some people are weakly and other people are stronger in their mind.  The internet is a good way for those stronger people to threaten the weak people who prefer using the internet because they're shy. However, sometimes the internet can have a positive impact on relationships.  Indeed, that's the easiest way to speak and socialize.  Indeed, you can't always see people.  Then, your smartphone is in your pocket in you can easily talk to a friend who's maybe abroad. To sum up, I will say that social media can have positive and negative impacts.  we have to be very carefully when we use social media if we want its to have positive impacts.  Internet can be easily misused and some people can be hurted.  However, we have to adapt our way of life in this new world with all that technologies.

Usually, we can see those kids eating a hamburger-fries-soda menu of any well-know food chain. Is it what we want for our present and future? As I can see it, I agree completely with the statement proposed: eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. It doesn't mean that it is not allowed to eat a menu as the above described, but not everyday nor everyweek! When we eat a balanced diet we give our organism all the vitamins, antioxidants, essential oils, ions,... that it needs without necessity of supplementary pills to improve our intake. We will have all the energy needed as long as we have proteins, fat, carbohydrates and vegetables everyday. We will feel full of power and ready to deal with whichever our aims are! Unfortunately, some people is afraid of eating fat and/or carbohydrates as part of their diet because they think they will put on weight. It is necessary for our organism to get what it needs in the simplest way and avoid it unnecessary efforts to get it. As a result, our body will only get undesirable secondary products that could even end poissoning it. So, as long as we fancy a balanced diet and combine it with some exercise, we will be ready for the healthiest way of life.

                 Dear reader, let me share with you a little of what I gain by being schooled at Liège city. Any level of expectation is subject to a scale. In my understanding, unit of measurements have been made and are maintained by humans. In other words, talking about eating a balanced diet as the most important factor for a healthy life, remains what humankind has always been trying to do : compare itself to its ability to tailor its own scale, which should be the best if the wiĺlingness of continious positive improvement exist. The real question is : who is scaling the initial scale in order to keep as long as possible the power of the scale ownership factor  ? ..  Health is like the factor  which has to be closely monitored. Without being healthy any human lost their mind. So to be a good scaler one should absolutely be as healthy as possible. What if life is not understandable at the highest state of consciouness, who will be able to judge weather choices are what is called balanced ? History shows that any species alive deserves what is best for them but jealousness as failed in giving what any species really deserves. Free choices as well as imposed ones are not anymore at stake.

Indeed, a lot of programmes and associations propose to the students different opportunities to do part of their studies abroad. For example, the Erasmus program is very popular in the universities. I think it would be a good solution to force the students to do at least one year in another country. In fact, study abroad could increase open-mindedness.

For years, the governments in each country all over the world has tried to improbe the ways of teaching. Of course, il may be interesting to take different opinions and proposals into account, but as far as I am concerned, too much information kill information. Moreover, if too many individual initiatives aiming to improve existing dispositions which were once successful and efficient, it could in a rather near future destroy the basis of our past. How often don't we refer to Egypt in amazing attitudes concerning the discoveries and beauties ? Today is based on yesterday.  Each country, with or without frontiers, needs to conserve its identity and remain curious to learn from the others.  But the family cells must be protected to grow with the foreign countries in its own land. Live together is wonderful but let's keep our school sweet school at home!

                 It is probably true to say that people living in the public eye have a extraordinary life. Some people even argue that they are living a dream. However, I am doubtful about the true quality of living of people exposed in public. Of course celebrity might be tempting because it brings attention and opens many locked doors. Nonetheless, being constantly observed by curious and intrusive persons is just the tip of the iceberg. Their whole life is examined and judged by envious people. Who has never dreamed of being a star, a politician that has a huge influence on mass media and who can defend their opinion pubicly? I am persuaded that it is a feeling we have all had at least once in our life. Notwithstanding, we tend to only see the bright side of a public function. Indeed, these people have no right to privacy or quite few: grocery shopping, sightseeing, taking their children to school are basic things celebrities cannot do peacefully. Of course stars make mistakes, but who does not ? The only difference is that their mistakes are judged and analized by pseudo-experts who think they will have a perfectly non reprehensible life. I must say that most of us are hypocritical when we judge notorious people since we often make the same mistake than them. In conclusion, I am truely convinced that people living in the public eye need and should have a right to privacy. I am scared that a lack of private life could have a dramatic outcome like the ones we have known in the past ",0.6666666666666666,70.53,8.04,8.87,24.5,264.0,15.0,378.0,26.0,17.6,1.4318181818181819,0.5795454545454546,9.416499059918953,6.658470340305442,80.96000000000001

                 On one hand social networks represent a huge contributions to remotelly  located relationships allowing them to keep contact no matter of the distance. On the other hand relationships between people located at the same place might suffer because of the attention we are putting in monitoring our social network and remote relationships forgetting to take advantage of the actual presence in front of us at the very real space and time where we are. In addition, social networks enables us to stablish relationships with people we would not met in normal life because of the distance or because they are belonging to different social groups. Nevertheless, this social network are creating less deeper and very fragile relationships exchanging about superfluous matters, while with real presence relationships subjects of discussion tend to be more profound and longuer and more stable relationships. We must know how to take advantage of these new social networks while reserving some time for real time and space relationships. The first is a only a ""tool"", the second ""real life"".

You know I'm not a good cook so I prefer  you ask it to another person. After the meal I'll do the dishes and we could do an animation with the guests.

                 In order to take a stance on that statement, it is necessary to give a more accurate definition of the word ""privacy"". According to me, the right to privacy relates to the possibility, not of hiding some of our actions, but to be able to live without having  judging eye following us in our thoughts and deeds. With that in mind, it can possibly be stated that privacy is a necessary condition for freedom. It is indeed very unlikely to feel totally free while knowing everyone is watching. Consequently, I think this right has to be granted to every single human being, even to those whose lives are relentlessly exposed to the public. Furthermore, I think popular people should be able to decide wheter they some bits of their lives to be made public or not. In our communication-based society where scandals are a very profitable resource, it is of course more and more difficult for those people to keep the most private areas of their life away from greedy journalists looking for their next juicy headlines.Therefore, I think some ethical charter of journalism must be set up to prevent those people to have their lives outrageously exposed and (mis)judged by the public.

                 I think that eating a balanced is a central piece to maintain or reach a healthy lifestyle. It means that you can eat of everything, but in an appropriate amount compared to dietetic rules and food pyramid. If you exclude a category of nutriments or if you follow a monodiet regimen, it will have a worse impact on your body than doing nothing. Every category of nutriment is important: protein to construct the muscles, lipids to repair the cells, carbohydrats to give strenght and energy, but most of all water for life! Nevertheless, I've heard that without physical exercice, healthy diet is less effective. Combined with it, it can for instance revert type 2 diabetes symptoms, diminish the risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduce arthritis disorders. Healthy lifestyle is something global, it includes the diet, but also the physical exercice, the quality of sleep, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, emotional management, adaptation skills and social support.

                 I think that social networks are a usefull and powerfull tool from our century. They kind of change the way that people communicate with each other. Sometimes for the best but sometimes, unfortunately, for the worst. Nowadays there's nothing easier than staying in touch with people thanks to social networks. Just a few clicks and a little typing and you can say hello to your friends and make them remember that you don't forget them (even if they live in another country and you can't see them very often). You could also text them but social networks are free and now, seriously, who doens't have a smartphone ? With social networks you can also find back people you were with in high school and see what's going on with their lives. It's easy, cheap and it doesn't take a lot of time. Because, everybody knows that the lack of time is a commmon syndrom from our society... Even if social networks can improve relationships and make them last, they unfortunately also have the power to destroy them. How ? Words. When you're hidden behind a screen, it's easier to say things that you would never say in real life. People sometimes forget that they're actually talking to other real people because they don't see their face and their reactions. Who has never read some mean and disrespectful comments on Facebook ? In 2016, we can say that social networks take a big place in our daily life. People are ultra connected between them all the time. That's why we can affirm that social networks have a big influence on relationships. I think that that influence's going to change again for the years to come because the actual trend's never going to stop to evolve. Anyway respect is the key to keep nice and positive relationships.

                 We all have a right to privacy, people in the public eye aren't an exception, but the extent of their privacy depends on the function they have. There are limits to privacy for people in the public eye, nonetheless. A politician should have the right to go on holiday and live with his or her family without people snooping on them, but must remain open when excercising their public functions. Celebrities should be allowed to be left alone as long as they attempt to remain anonymous, but they waiver that right when they try and use their influence as a public figure to gain specific advantages. Notorious Criminals in the public eye should also expect to lose alot of their rights to privacy- personal rights end when the rights of others are compromised.

The only important thing in this world, for me, is to be happy and the best way to get happiness is to do good around us. In this sense, as we spend a lot of our time at work, it seems important to me to have a job where you can realize things that can help people, in one way or another, regardless of the money you get. For me, that's the true meaning of an 'enjoyable job'.

Be eat fast food, lots of sugar-base product and a lot of meat. Given these factors we have to make an important effort to achieve a healthy lifestyle. The importance of eating a balanced diet can be seen by the multiple advantages it procures. First eating a well balanced diet give the energy to go through your everyday life without feeling weak. It can also reduce the risk of having deadly disease as cancer. In most of the case, keeping a healthy lifestyle also reduces the impact we have on the environement.

Eating a good and balanced food is not expensive. In fact, it's even less expensive than buying prepared meals.

                 I think that following classes abroad should be a compulsory part of education. Firstly, we live today in a globalize world where everyone are interconnected. Most of the student now will work with people coming from around the world in their professional life. For those reasons, it's important to be open-minded and to be aware of the existence of different cultures. Secondly, studying abroad can give you a different point of view of a same topic. So, expecially as an academic student, it's necessary to see all the side of a subject. For example, following a class of industrial organization in Louvain-la-Neuve will no be the same as following the same lesson in Beijing. To conclude, thirty years ago the barriers to go studying abroad were the price of the trip and of the registration in the other insitution. Today those problems don't exist anymore: it's cheap to travel and instutions, like universities, have more and more contact between them so that the price of the inscription has reduced a lot.

                 The environment, our contemporary green gold, is key for human life, and after many years of drawing resources, the mankind has realised it is really necessary to stop this massacre until it becomes irremediable. In order to live on a sustainable manner without coming back to the Prehsitoric times, I would carry on building off-shore and inland wind turbines, multiplying solar panels on roofs and on parkings to load electric car. I would also encourage inhabitants from developed countries first, as they are more disposed financially to make efforts, to compost and plat trees in their garden and to sort out their wastes more consciously. As farmming has a big impact on our planet, it is an emergency to get people conscious about the need they decrease thei meat consumption. Though we already have observed changes, I would encourage financially companies, universities, schools that promote the right attitude and invest in and implement efficient autonomous facilities and the use of ecological products.

                 Last week, I attended a big fashion event in Paris. I went to Paris from thursday to monday evening. Paris is a fantastic city! The event was on saturday night in a big historic monument. It was magical. I met a lot of big names of the fashion industry. The show was on the afternoon, it started on 3 pm and ended one hour later. Before the show, a lot of photographs were at the entrance to take pictures of the last fashion clothes of the spectators. Once we were inside, we could find on each seats bags with presents from the brand in it, it is always great to receive free products from a brand. The show was beautiful, no one of the models did fall and their clothes were very nice. After that, I visit Paris. On monday evening, unfortunetly, I had to go back home, in Belgium.

                 Nobody can deny that in our modern daily life, social networks play a major role. Their appearance have changed the way we communicate with each other on a lot of aspects. Altough most of the people say that it has a real positive impact on our relationships because we can communicate more easily, I don't really think this way and I will explain why. First of all, relationships through social media are not real relationships. Some key points of communication are missing, such as eye contact and non-verbal communication in overall. When you say a few sentences on Facebook and Twitter, they don't necessarily have the same meaning as when you pronounce them whith emphasis or emotions. Although I recognise that social media make it easier for us to meet new friends and to gather us, it doesn't replace real relationships. Furthermore, the person you pretend you are on your profile page is not your true self. On social media, you can filtrate all the informations about you and you can even lie and make up a new life. Consequently, you are never certain of the identity of the person you are speaking with and you can cheat your interlocutor. To sum up, you could have some big surprises when you meet your Facebook friends face to face. In one sentence, the social networks gather people and expand our friends circle but at the same time it replaces our relationships by fake ones.

                 Nowadays, the internet is a part of our daily life. But it doesn't mean that it has only advantages. Knowing lots of people doesn't mean you are close to them. On the social networks we can have niew friends with one click and it is easy to meet the all world. We can keep in touch with people that are on the other side of the world. But we are hiding behind a screen and we can lie about our real personality and who we really are. Social networks can lead to an isolated behaviour because in real life we can't lie about who we really are and it is harder for some people to tell the thruth. Social networks can also have benefits for shy or busy people if they are afraid of meeting people or if they don't have the time to. It gives you the opportunity to meet other people than your colleagues or your family. I think that knowing too many people doesn't mean you are close to them. It is better to have a few friends but really knowing them. The internet can help to keep in touch but not to know other people. The best way is to meet them in real life.

                 It's probably true to say that eating a balanced diet is a key factor for a healthy life. Some people may refer to the well known sentence ""Mens sana in corpore sano"". Needless to say, the first step to be healthy is to eat well. However, I am not sure that a balanced diet is the most important goal to have an healthy life. Firt of all, diet can very fast become a source of stress when people attach to much importance to it. Clearly we all know someone whi is a diet freak. Secondly, nowadays it is hard to find easily healthy products which are affordable. Indeed, eating good products has a price. Furthermore, there are many others factors to take into account when we talk about healthy life. I tend to think that sport contributes to have a healthy life as much as a balanced diet. I do not mean by this that sport is the most important factor but it sure is essential to be in good shape. Meanwhile, I am convinced that people who care about eating variate and healthy are more enclined to have a healthy life. Studies have shown that they are often less tired, more motivated, more concentrated and better looking. While I accept that eating a balanced diet is very important I feel that there are a lot of orther factors to take into account.

                 In my opinion, it should be a part of education, since it's a great experience for a student, especially those who aren't able to go abroad, mostly due to financial reasons. It is important to travel around the world, to be able to see all the different cultures, to understand that we all have different lifestyles and that we have to learn new things from others. How are we supposed to learn if we don't move and see different things ? We need to be confronted with other people, different ones, with their own point of view, so that we can increase our knowledge. Traveling is a wonderful experience that can help us to become more responsible for our self and for the world in general, we don't only learn new things about other cultures and their livings, but we also learn who we truly are and what we want for the future.

                 Yes, i think that it should be mandatory because we have to be immerse in another country to learn well the language. Learning a language in our country is not enought, we just have more or less 4 hours at the university, so really not enought to be fluent. Nowadays without the capacity of speaking others languages, it's almost impossible to find a job. Furthermore, going overseas is a way to improve the language but it also a way to learn to be ressourceful, responsive and blooming. It's also an great opportunity to meet people from different cultures, and to discover their cultures. So yes, for me study abroad should be a part of our schooling.

                 It shouldn't because it's not easy for everyone to be comfortable with that. It's difficult to be away from friends and family. Another reason is that if the person is not very motivated to study abroad, he won't really try to speak and learn English (or another language). It's very important to study a foreign language, but it will be very stressfull to go studying in a foreign country and to stay in a foreign family. Furthermore, studying abroad has a cost. A lot of families don't have enough money to allow that. If parents have many children (for example three or more), it will cost to much to allow to all their children to study abroad.

                 N.B. I did not know the word ""compulsory"" and I needed to check the translation :) Yes, I think that it would be very interesting for each kid and teenager to study abroad at some moments of his scolarity. In general and especially in Belgium, be opened to different languages is really important. Belgium is a trilingual country. But a lot of belgian people are not familiar with the three languages. ""False immersion"" in a school based in its own village or its own city is quite artificial. And until studying abroad is not compulsory, it would be a kind of leisure for some students. So I think that real scholar programmes with immersion already in other regions inside the country and also outside the country would be very profitable for everybody. Be opened to foreign languages, other cultures, other mentalities, other uses, other environments is an important part of education, a way to grow up and to understand the world. But there is of course a lot of questions. Which budget for the State, which organisation for the school and for the families, ...? Complicated to create that!

                 At the moment, there are a lot of student who want to study abroad in their last year of education. Their main reason is to improve their level of a foreign language. For this same reason, I think that study abroad be a compulsory part of education. In deed, with it, students improve very fast a foreign language. It is more efficient that learn the language by themselve because they are using it in the real life with people who just speak in the foreign language and so it's faster and easier to learn the language. However, I'm not really sure that study abroad be a compulsory part of education for each student. In deed, some study don't need to be accompagned with a foreign language. The natal language could be only necessary. This is the case for example for the psychology, medicine, etc.. Also, I think that if study abroad is an obligation, students will not live it like a reward but more like a punishment. They will not be happy to improve their language and so that could be a very bad experience. Finally, study abroad be a complusory part of education for the main part of education but it would not be an obligation.

                 I don't totaly agree with that point of view. For sure, eating a balanced diet is necesary for a healthy life, but it is not enough. Sport is very important too. It is not necessary to work out intensivly but people need to be moving. It is very unhealthy to stay sit all day long, even if you have an healthy diet. Scientists found out that staying sit all day long is very dangerous and that it kills a lot of people every year, just like smoking ! Moreover it is also very important not to party too much, not too drinkg too much alchool. According to me, an other important factor is the way you feel inside. For an healty life, you got to feel good in your head, to be happy, to be possitive and to enjoy life. So for an healthy life, you need a balanced diet, you need to be working out and you need to be possitive about your life. Those are the ingredients for an healthy life.

                 According to more and more people, eating a balanced diet is one of the most factor for a healthy life. From my point vieuw, I totally agree with this. Healthy is definitely one of the most important thing that has importance for people and they actually care more and more about it. Being healthy depends on a lot of things and also things that we are not able to control, I mean some diseases are not forecastable. But there are also other things that we are able to manage and that can have a huge impact on our health. For example a balanced diet, I'm pretty sure that a balanced diet can play a huge role in our health. By eating balanced meals every day I'm sure that we can improve some factors related to health care, for example lifetime. But having balanced meals shouldn't be the only thing that we have to take care about. If you want to be really healthy you also have to participate to some kind of activities like sport. Other factors could also have a huge impact, like relationship. Being well in mind could have a huge impact on health.

                 In my opinion every have a right to have a private life. Doing a job, that puts us in the public eye should not prevent us keeping a part of our life secret for the others. It is not because we are famous that everybody has to know everything about us. Nevertheless those people accept somehow to have privacy as the jobs they are doing get them to be known by a lot of people. Morever nowadays it is getting harder to know where is the line between private and public life. Indeed, with all the social networks even the ones who are nor living in the public eye have less and less privacy. You can see on Instagram or Facebook, what people eat, wear, buy and so on.I am personally not very into social network because I don't think that everybody doesn't have to know what I am doing with who. In conclusion people who live in the public eye have a right to have privacy because everybody needs it. However they have to aware that if they live in the public eye, the line between private and public life will change and it will be harder to keep things unknown by people.

                 I've always thought that the way we stalk actors, models and even celebrities we don't even know why we do know them, like Kim K, is one of the creepiest hobbies of the human kind. There is strictly no reason why we should know Orlando Bloom's first baby's name, or what did Jennifer Anniston ate yesterday, ... So yes, to me, they definitly should have a right to privacy because it can drive you crazy to be constantly followed by paparazzis and fans, every step you take is watched by someone, every mistake you do is recorded. That's a terrible life. But we can say that, in a way,  the only reason why they still live in the public eye, why they're still celebrities, is because of the huge work of journalists and admirors... How would they exist to us if no one make them famous by talking about them? That's the exact mind-tricking issue. We don't even realise anymore they're a part of our lifes and we know them better than we think. For example, Leonardo Di Caprio. Let's imagine I saw only one of his movies, and I don't particuliary watch TV so I don't hear a lot about him but I'm on Facebook; I'm still attacked by funny pictures, web articles, informations about him that I don't especially want to know. At the end of one hour of Facebook, I already know that he won his first Oscar, that he divorced like 5 times, that he's actually on a boat with some gorgeous model and that he loves coffee. It's like advertising; you can barrely escape from it. Now there's the part when they know that they're recorded, that they choose to stay in the light instead of the shadows, because that's their best chance to earn more and more money, being chosen because of their celebrity for movies and stuffs... So the real question is: do they claim a right to privacy? That's up to them.

                 I believe that the impact of social networks on relationships can be both positive and negative, indeed, thanks to this new technology we have access to new ways of interacting with each other. Even if social networks can be useful some times, for example, in a long distance relationship these networks can also be damaging for the couple. As an example, Nowadays, if someone wants to proof its love, he will no longer need to write long poems, or buy flowers. Love has been reduced to something as simple as uploading a picture of you and your partner and write a romantic caption. Nevertheless, not everything is negative social networks can be very positive to romantic relationships, but more precisely, to friendships. Indeed, social networks keep us connected to our beloved and give us the opportunity to be updated with the latest news. Social networks can make us feel as if we were just next to our people even if we are kilometers away.

                 The most important factor of a healthy life When confronted to the question of how to lead a healthier life, it is imperative to talk about the diet we choose to impose on our bodies, and the effects we seek to obtain through it. A healthy life is acquired through a series of disciplined habits, eating healthy is only one of those. it would be interesting to ask ourselves what aspect of our health we wish to improve. Whether it is our weight, our cholesterol, our body's acceptance of certain vitamins, the way we eat plays an important role. However, for this purpose, eating a balanced diet must usually be combined with a healthy exercise routine. While exercising, an important amount of toxins is eliminated and our metabolism is accelerated. Thus, it is safe to conclude, that eating a balanced diet is essential to leading a healthier life, but it will achieve better results if accompanied by a daily exercise routine.

                 In my opinion, everyone wants to reach happiness. That idea is what drives people throughout their lives, what influences them the most when facing important choices. Now, in a world where capitalism has so deeply spreaded in all aspects of the society that wealth became the principle value by which a person can mesure his success and thus, his happiness, grinding money for the sake of it seems like the rational thing to do. Should {name}, who truly enjoys chess, try to find a chess-related job ? Sure, why not ? But what if this job doesn't provide enough money for her to carry about her future family ? Perhaps she could study chess-related field like mathematics, psychology or computer science and get a job with a bigger salary ? At this point, one could easily argue that she might end up burned out and unhappy with her job, but my main argument here is : the best answer to the question stands in both statements. However, this is also a matter of proportion. Indeed, there is a level beyond which salary by itself has less value that happiness. To conclude, I think that making money is more important as you are less rich, whilst caring for having an enjoyable job is a privilege of wealthier people.

                 At first, we can consider social network as an easy way to keep in touch with other people (for instance : friends from childhood, close ones living far away...), as well as a manner to discover new people ""by chance"" on the internet enabling us to widen our circles. We could then conclude that social network has positive impacts on relationships. However, we can easily observe in our daily lives that people tend to lock themselves more and more in their house to communicate only by messages through internet which reduces the frequency of real conversations ""face-to-face"". Besides, there's also the persecution problem which happens a lot more often than we all think and which has already caused deaths of lots of teenagers. . In one word, I believe that social networks could be beneficial for relationships with some limits. Indeed what I fear the most is the loss of human contact.

The world is fully connected, you can find anything anywhere on the Internet. You can also see and talk with people instantly all over the world. You have access to worldwide news and much more information. About social networks impacting on our lives, these should be certainly used with moderation, they should not be interfeering with our social life until cutting off our real social life. If used with wisdom and carefulness, these social networks are very usefull and meaningfull when organization is needed, for example : at the university, everyone can share course notes, information about schedules, etc. In conclusion, social networks are really convenient in everyday's life if used correctly and not too frequently.

                 Well, I guess that social networks allow people to maintain more relationships than before, even though these relationships are less consistent than those in real life. But still, people can get information about ""friends"" they won't meet again anytime soon. This leads to what we could call a feeling of knowing about these people. In fact, social networks users tend to expose their life, and it allows their contacts to know way more than what they would know if their relationship didn't include social networks. But in my opinion, social networks are useful tools to maintain social contacts. You can use them to get in touch with old friends, to invite people to an event of yours in an easier way or to keep tuned about your friends' news in a more efficient way. All you have to do is browse an application or a webpage and in an eyeblink you can get informations that you would have got with a dozen of phone calls and a hundred of texts - or even worse, letters.

                 First i'll give as an important advice, to turn off the the tap while brushing teeth. People often forget to turn it off and waste a lot of water while we know that water is the new gold for it's coming rarety. As a second advice, i'll say to recycle bin, plastic with plastic paper with paper, as we know a lot of used thing can be re-used after recycling, like Antoine Lavoisier said : ""nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed"". The third advice will be, to think every day about the least polluant way to do things, as transport (for example : going at work by walking or with a bike or with public tranports) but too with the alimentation by eating season fruit or vegetables (not exported food which is really polluant by the use of trucks and plane or ships).

                 Two years ago, I went in Italy with my parents and my grand-parents in July to discover the village of my grand-father in Bergamo. It was the first time that I went in this city and it was really a beautiful trip.  Firstly, the weather was very good. Every day was sunny and the sky was blu. The landshappes were wonderful because of the high mountains and the beautiful lake that passed through the village. Secondly, I have meet the family of my grand-father for the first time. His sisters and brothers and also his nieces. The life there is poor but people live with the necessary, there are simple and they are rich in what they have learnt in their life. Moreover, I have seen the house in which my grand-father was born and has growth. Now, they have built an italian restaurant in this place..the things are changing...herbs are replaced into cement..clams are changed into buildings...the worlds is falling down...  The day after, We went to the cimetery to pray for the ones that aren't there yet. The last day, we visted the center of Bergamo. In the old part of the city, there are a lot of old museums, churches, typical bakeries and restaurants. In the modern part of the town, there are especially many shops and bars.  I will always remember this holiday because this trip was rich in emotions, in discoveries and in surprises. The city was amazing and it's important to know where we really come from.

                 In my opinion, this statement is basically true. It has been shown by several studies that malnutrition and/or one-sided nutrition is not healthy in the long run and also affects mood, motivation and wellbeeing in general. We all know that we do not feel particularly good when we eat nothing but fast-food for a week or have just devoured a complete chocolate cake. However, being obsessed about your diet, constantly thinking about it and restricting yourself too much is not healthy either. For me a healthy balanced diet means also that I can eat what I crave for. Usually, the body knows best what he wants. If you are thirsty, you drink water. If you need salt, you want to eat salty food etc. Of course, we can also not completely give in to our cravings, but it is important to find a healthy balance to achieve a healthy life-style.

                 Social networks : destroyer or potitif factor on relationships ? On one hand, I strongly believe that social networks can have a negative impact on relationships because it keeps away real link between people. I need to see my friends face to face to Internet can not remplace a genuine relation between friends. I do not trust in e-relation as it sounds fake. Social networks are not the real life, not natural, not spontaneous. On the other hand, social networks can be usefull to keep in touch with everyone you desire to linked to. Time flight and we do not always find the time to meet up with friends. Social networks are really usefull to have news, see pictures, talk to friends while you can not see them face to face. To conclude, I trust that social networks have either negative and positive impact on relationships.Using it with moderation and not as the only way to maintain or create a connection.

                 My answer to this question is yes, famous people do have a right to privacy. Artists, actors, musicians, politicians (and so on) don't need every single aspects of their life known and shown to the whole world. The only thing that should matter is if these people do their job right. As long as they don't break any rule, why should we know who they married and what their children look like or if they cheated,... Furthermore, media making money by invading privacy are often terrible. Examples of this are tabloids or reality show like the Kardashians. That is not good TV. It's getting harder and harder for celebrities to keep their private life private, with the increase of social media and everybody owning a camera phone.

                 People who live in the public eye certainly do have a right to privacy. This is a fundamental right of all human beings. However, the reality is probably that this right is not respected. For many famous persons, we see too often private pictures or information relative to intimacy published in tabloids. I cannot imagine that stars, politicians, members of royal families, etc. can go out in any public place without the fear of being recognised. If I were them, I would feel that as a violation of my freedom and of one of the most basic human rights. Medias and fans seem to forget that famous people are as human as they are and that they have the same needs, dreams, fears and hopes as anybody else. Yet, there may be some exceptions: some people who actually like to see their whole life becoming public. They may accept to lose their privacy in the name of glory and fame. But I believe that this is rare and that most famous people actually wish to see their right to privacy respected.

                 In my opinion, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram have a big impact on relationships. Because you always have to be careful of what you post in the public sphere. Pictures or even words can produce real troubles and can cause public disruptcies on the social life of the person who has posted them on the internet. Those social networks can also make trouble within families, because of a uncareful word in a commentary or in a conservation, families can be separated. Social networks have change the meaning of relationships and there is no turn around on that turf. If you're active on a social network, you'll always have to be careful of what you say because it is hard to repair something on the internet, it is not the same if you have the person in front of you and you can tell or what you mean.

                 Social networks such as Facebook can have postive impacts as well as negative impacts on relationships. On the one hand, Facebook can be very helpful to look for friends you've lost sight of. It's always a warm feeling when you find out they did great in life. Also, you can share happy or sad moments of your life and friends can react to it. Another great thing about Facebook is that you can join groups about specific subjects like a singer you love, your hobby or your favorite football team, and meet new people who have the same center of interest as you. I'd like to add that, having many friends living in Paris, I was so relieved, thanks to Facebook app, to know that all of them were safe after the terrorist attacks on 13 November. On the other hand, Facebook is very intrusive in your private life as it knows everything you watch, you do and so on. Also, everything you post on Facebook become Facebook's property which is, in my opinion, definitely abnormal. For some specific public, Facebook can be particularly harmful. For exemple, teens can be bullied online which may sometimes lead to suicide. Also, teenagers are not always aware of the danger of publishing pictures or accepting anyone as a friend. Who knows if this person is a perv! In general, you need to be very careful about what you post and whom they post it to, especially when it concerns you professional or your love life. You don't want your girlfriend to know you cheated on her with Facebook, or your boss to find out you lied about being sick as hell while you were in fact sunbathing in the Bahamas! To conclude, I think social networks like Facebook are double-edged swords. People need to be very careful about what they post and whom they post it to. Parents must control their kids' use of social network to be sure they're safe. Despite these inconveniences, social networks are wonderful to keep in touch with friends or to discover new inspiring and loving people!

                 Most people think that social networks are just alienating and addictive networks, that are bad for people because it reduces communication and interactions in the real life. However, in my opinion, there are still many benefits behind it. First of all, social networks promotes organisation. People can talk to an entire group in the same time, they can describe really precisely an event that they are organising, they can update data,... On social networks like Facebook, you can say ""I participate"" or ""I don't"" and this make it very easier for the person who organises the event. Second of all, social networks are really great for creating bonds between people that would never have existed otherwise. To exemplify that, imagine you are part of a football group on Facebook, you know that every member of the group (even the ones that you don't know yet) share your passion. Another example is the fact that people can take contact easily to professionals thanks to LinkedIn. However, I can't deny that social networks are sometimes dangerous. It might convey information that is not true. Some people might get hurt by what other people say. Some people might develop unhealthy relationships. And a lot of people might talk rubbish because they are hiding behind a screen.

                 Humans, like all the other animals, need to eat to live. Indeed, nutriment intake is the main source of energy for our bodies and therefore one of the most important aspect of our health. In fact, one can live without exercices, one can live without sun (albeit indirectly humans need sunlight), or one can even live without social life or intellectual activity. Science shows us that to fulfill our bodily needs, we need certain amounts of nutrients; vitamins, cereals, amino acids, fats and minerals among others. It is even more the case for certain category of people, namely sportives, physically active adults, children, teenagers, pregnant women and to a different extent elderly people. A balanced diet is therefore very important for an optimal health. Too much fat, and it can highly increase the risk of several illness, such as cancers or obesity. Not enough fats on the other hand will cause problems to the nervous system. Amino acids are needed for our body to create proteins, which will then be used to fuel our muscular tissues. Exemple are numerous, but how do nowadays sedentary humans cope with these needs? A lot of sendentary societies find themselves with several health problems due to several factors of our modern post-industrial society. Dietary wise, there are many factors but let's talk about one of the main one: overconsumption of animal-based nutrients. The modernization of our agricultural method has made production of meat and dairy products much easier and has made the price of these products much cheaper in many developped countries. Despite of the efforts of the agro-industrial lobbies, most animal products have shown to be harmfull for the human physiology, especially when consummed in big quantities, which is the case is many countries, like China, USA and EU countries to name a few. Most meats and fishes provide us with significant and unnecessary amount of bad cholesterol for instance, or when consumming more than a few hundred grams of meat per week, give us amount of proteins exceeding highly our needs. But in meat consumption, red meat is definitly the most dangerous product and has been classified recently as a cancerogenous product by health authorities. Red meat intake increase the risks of heart problems or digestive systems failures and cancers. To go on the positive side, societies with little animal products consumption show signs of better health and longer lives, as it can be seen in some part of China or India where meat consumption is rare. Vegetarian and vegan diets have also shown their proves for physically actives and non actives people as a very suitable dietary option. Recently, the ADA (American Dietary Association) has shown vegetarianism and veganism as very possible diets for a healthier life. If one decide to carry on eating meat on a regular basis, several health specialists recommend eating meat up to 3 times a week maximum, with amounts of meat or fishs in these meals not being higher then 100g. Researchs show that leguminous plants such as beans, peas and soy would be much more efficients source of amino acids, if mixed properly with adapted grains (such as rice with lentils, wheat with peas, etc.). These news are now wide spread amongst developped countries and we can assume that in the next few decades, it will be harder for the agro-industrial lobbies to make their propaganda so succesfull. {initial}. {name} ",0.6999999999999998,54.97,9.44,11.55,33.5,565.0,23.0,867.0,80.0,24.565217391304348,1.5345132743362833,0.5185840707964602,12.326602644011967,8.71622431857289,90.36216517857142

                 Though I would have fully agreed with the statement a few years ago, I now believe that the quality of the food is what matters, more than a balanced diet unfortunately. A study has demonstrated that the weight of an average adult nowadays is higher (and not slightly, we speak of a difference of 20kg) than the weight of an average adult in the seventies with a comparable physical activity.  Another study states that in order to ingest the same amount of vitamins than an appel 30 years ago, we would have to eat 30 to 40 appels. Though the balance diet surely helps to live an healthy life, it is thus not in my eyes, the most important factor.  Quality! That what we need.  Food is fuel for our body. The lower the quality of the food, the more we need to ingest in order to reach the needed levels of vitamins and minerals. Our vitality and mood depend on those, but we than endanger our weight!

                 First of all, I'll just say that every little things are important. There are not ""little initiatives"". Let take the example of Louvain-La-Neuve, if every students try to sort the waste or take the train, it means that nearly 30 000 persons (whithout all the personals) are taking care of the environment. So, the first advice I can give is to see the big picture and don't think that your personal initiative are useless because we are thousands to do the same. Secondly, people could try to buy local products. It is difficult because we never know from where procucts come, that's why we need to create some labels for our local products (it will avoid a lot of pollution if we reduce the freight of some products). Finally, we could eat less fish and meat, for example we can try to eat veggie the week-end because we have much time to cook. The change could come from entreprises and governments because they can take important decisions about pollution and so on but first we have to show that we care about environment by doing ""our little initiatives"".

                 I don't totally agree with this sentence. Of course, to have a healthy life you need to look after what you eat but this isn't the main thing. You will also need to do some sport. I am not talking about going to the gym, walking or cycling instead of taking the car when possible is enough, as long as it is done more than once a week. Moreover, a healthy life depends on your sleep time. having a good a night sleep is important. Drinking plenty of water is a factor which will help you get a healthier life. Our body needs water to work properly. it will help remove waste and it will carry nutrients and oxygen as well. Avoiding alcohol and cutting smoking can also help. Those 2 things don't bring anything good to your body. You are likely to have cancer and liever disease. Smoking gives you bad breath and teeths problems. this might be a silly thing but from my point of view, think positive can also give you a healthier life. You will evacuate the stress which can cause sometimes health isssues. Finally, we come to a point to say that a healty life depends to many factors as important as each other.

For example, if you brush your teeth or when you clean yourselfe with bath soap, don't let de water flow. Or in winter, if you have a little cold, don't rise the radiator but take a big pullover and wear it.

                 For starters, social networks have spread the ease to communicate and to meet new people. Thus, the feeling that it generates can often be of mistrust. Furthermore, the problem acutes when all the information is published and is able to be seen by anyone. Moreover, social networks often make relationships pend form a thread given that acces is not restrincted and when so, the closest people are surely going to be able to see posts, comments, pictures, etc. Hence, it is problably better to keep one distanced from social networks at a certain scale. Finally, social networks can also be a tool to enhance relationships when it comes to sharing ones love and interests. It can enhance the way one can get to know someone else, it's behavior with friends, family and/or colleages. Social networks are, hence, a complex tool that can work for or against relationships, this is why it has always been a polemic topic.

                 As a student, I would be really delighted if I could study abroad and discover new horizons. Travelling bring experience to the students and that can be really useful in the professional life. It gives them a new look to everyday-problem and this new look can help in future decisions making. But these abroad studies would have a cost some students couldn't afford. If these travels were compulsory, it would cost the student or the state. I think that nearly free education is far too expensive for the state to add travels like these. While studying in a foreign country is a necessary experience, it can be a real financial burden. In my opinion, making them compulsory is a bad idea but these academic travels must be facilitate for everyone.

                 The right to privacy has never been as important as it is today. Wherever we look, this issue keeps making the front page of every newspaper. The progresses of technology makes it increasingly harder to guarantee it. Among those concerned by the issue, movie stars and VIP's. In this essay, it will be discussed about the right to privacy for those who live in the public eye. The right to privacy is principle that can be found in every democracy in the world. It is tightly bound to other principles such as freedom of speech, freedom of thaught, secrecy of the vote, etc. It garantees to every citizen the right to live the life he/she choosed to live, without having to face other people's opinions an judgements. That being said, the importance of this right can be easily understood. If the right to privacy is considered to be essential for every citizen, there is no reason to think that it could be denied to VIP's just  because their job involves a public part. Besides, fame isn't always a choice, but rather the consequence of a succesfull carreer in a certain area. For instance, a writer agrees to sell a book to a reader, but that doesn't mean he agrees to have every detail of his private life revealed.

                 I think an enjoyable job is way more important, as long as you make enough money to live comfortably. If you are not happy when you work then it is a big problem because you do your job everyday for quite a few hours and during a big period of time. Money is of course important because you need some to live, to eat, to do stuffs on the weekends... But happiness is more than that ! If you don't like your job, you come home everyday in a bad mood and that's not nice for your family, your roomates, ... In the end, you need both, a nice job that you like and enough money to be comfortable at the same time. If you can achieve that then it is up to you to be happy. Of course that is not accurate for everybody. Some people need more money other less. And there are less fortunate people in this world with not really one or the other but they still can be happy.

                 Yes, there should be a separation between private and professionnal life. Even tough a part of some people's job is to be famous, well knowned, and therefore being seen, they should have the right to a private life. The devellopment of their children and their couple relation might be endangered with the omnipresence of photographs and media in their life. They already have to bear this situation at their work or when they show themselves, and it's got to be enough pressure. So let them have a family life without trying to sneak in! Isn't it the first amendement of the constitution to have the right to freedom? And what freedom is greater than the freedom to be forgotten to be eyes of the others, the ones that you do not care about. And this, to be more present to those you love, because real love don't come from a horde of unknowned people! This kind of love is called ""admiration"" and this is so futile that you can lost all admiration in one time. But you will always get the love you deserve. If you deserve it!

                 ""Brassicole the 16th of March"" On the 16th and 17th of Marchn there was an event organised on the ULB campus, a university of Brussels. My friends asked me whether I wanted to join them to have some free time over there and to have a drink, I decided to meet them up right there even if I didn't want to spend so much money. As I'm working in a delivery restaurant, it occurs that some generous customers give us, me and my colleagues, some tips, so I wouldn't really spend my own money and I could, kind of, enjoy for free. I picked a friend up to reach the others in Brussels and I parked my car in the Franklin Roosevelt Avenue without paying attention where I was parked. We've had a great moment over there and I didn't drink so much as I had to drive to go back home. At 11pm, we were about to leave and some friends grabbed us to have a last drink before ending the night, therefore it was 11.30pm when we were on the way to the Franklin Roosevelt Avenue. We arrived on the place I was parked but I couldn't see my car anymore, I have been looking for it for a while without any result. So I called the number of the breakkdown service of Brussels and they told me my car wasn't parked at the right place and I had to go and pay a certain amount to get it back. I didn't know how I was going to go there to pick it up and how to get home firstly, the only thing I knew was that my tips wouldn't be enough to pay the tow truck which had towed away my car....

                 I think that study abroad is a beautiful experience for some students. They learn a new langage, meet new people and discover a new culture. But for others, being far from what they know, from their friends and family, could be catastrophic. For example, there are host families who are totally unfriendly with foreigner students. In this case, the student coul feel very bad, sad and maybe he will isolate him/herself from the social world. Furthemore, some students could be ""alone"" and lost when they go abroad to study. It could lead to school/academic failure and to depression. So I don't think that study abroad should be a compulsory part of education. It depends too much on the student's personality and the situation within he/she will be.

                 Do people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy ?! Of course, they do. Why shouldn't they ? Because they represent us ? Because they are public figures ? I do not agree. They sould have the same rights as any citizen, but they could, maybe, have a few more duties than the average citizen. The right of privacy is included in the human right charter and as far as I am concerned, politicians are also humans. So, as most of the countries in the world signed the human rights charter, almost all the countries should stick to it and enforce it ! Those men and women in the the public eye have husband and wife, children and maybe grandchildren. Why should their family suffer of untimely harassment from the medias ?

In place of having real contacts with other people, and building real relations, we are sitting in front of our screens, sharing unimportant news to people we don't really know. We have less 'deep' relationships and are staying more and more on artificials connexions.

So for students who are learning new language it should be a compulsory part of education because you can't learn a new language without immersion.

                 Money and enjoyable job, both are important. I need money to live and I also need to feel comfortable with my Job. Having not enought money is not comfortable because it means saving money.To have to much money is also not comfortable, because a lot of persons should be jealous and would like to have your money. Having an enjoyable job means to feel comfortable at work : you do wat you like with people you like. Having a boring job means to do things you don't like with people you don't like all the day and every day. I think it is more important to have an enjoyable job because you do what  you like with people you like so that working is a way to feel well. If you have a job witch pays verry well but is boring you might have friends who want your money and colleges you don't like. When should you open out ? Of course having a lot of money means to have the oportunity to do a lot of funny things. but doing funny things doesn't mean to open out.
