"Women have traditionally had a minor role in
professional football but this may be changing.
France has just employed its first female
professional team manager. It did not matter that
it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it
was, as some people suggested, just a publicity
stunt for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63.
Clermont is 14th out of the 20 teams in its league
at the moment.","Women have traditionally played a minor role in

"What mattered was that they gave Helena
Costa the top job. This has made football history
because she is the first female manager in the
top two divisions of any professional European
league. As a woman, its made me happy,
said Vronique Soulier, president of the clubs
supporters association. When I first heard the
news, I was surprised, but, then, we all agreed
that its good news. We all agree that a woman at
the head of a group of men is no bad thing.","What mattered was that Helena Costa had been

"The president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude
Michy, gave Costa, 36, a two-year contract.
Michy is very good at keeping his club in the
news. In 2013, he told everyone the team had

Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, but Junior
Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder
from Cameroon.","Costa, 36, was appointed on a two-year contract

"Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only
previous woman coach of a mens professional
team, said: I dont know Helena, but, if she has
been hired by a team, then it means that she
knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day,
this can become normal. Morace played for Italy
in 153 internationals. In 1999, she became coach
of the mens team Viterbese. But, after only two
games, she resigned from the job because of a
disagreement with the clubs owner. She added:
I see too many men, even in the womens game,
who do not have the same expertise as women
but are working. And the women are not working.","Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only

French national team, said: Women know how
to play football and how to manage and are good
at doing it. Why shouldnt they manage mens
teams? The opposite happens and doesnt cause
any problems. Its a natural choice and reflects
our society in which women are equal to men. I
say well done to President Michy. I told myself
that, if I took control of a club again, Id hire a
woman as my number two. Michy did it first.","Raymond Domenech, former manager of the

"Clermont Foot 63 says that Costas becoming
the teams manager will allow the club to enter
a new era. On the club supporters website,
reaction to Costas becoming the manager was
mixed. In my opinion, its just a publicity stunt to
get people talking about the club. I find it hard to
believe shell be able to get the players respect,
above all when shes the same age as the
oldest, wrote one fan. Her CV isnt bad, but now
the question is: will she be good enough? added
another. A third wrote: I wish her welcome and
success but I think itll be hard for her to do well

they dont have at the moment, she said. The

demanding.","But Soulier was hopeful: Hopefully, with the new
