"It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided
to go for a swim from Doolin Pier in County Clare,
Ireland, where I moved in 2012. There was a
woman in the water with Dusty, a dolphin who
has a great relationship with a group of people
she regularly swims with. Dusty arrived in Doolin
in about 2008. Hundreds of people have swum
with her, so everyone thinks that shes
totally tame.","It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided

"That evening, the woman was tickling Dustys
tummy and it looked so nice in the water. There
were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier.
They were looking at this lovely sight. Just after I
got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was
with and went crazy  I found out afterwards that
shes very territorial when she is with somebody.
Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought
it was a display but, then, I realized she was
angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so
I swam towards the pier. But, within seconds,
Dusty crashed into me with her nose. It was very
powerful and painful, and the speed
was amazing.","That evening, the woman was tickling Dustys

forwards violently.","Dusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 and

She has even starred in an Irish tourist-board ad
campaign in which a girl says she would like to
touch a dolphin."
"All the people on the pier were staring at me with
their mouths open. Dusty was still in the water
beside me, her tail flapping crazily. That was the
most frightening thing: I thought, if she hits me
with her tail, I could go under the water
and drown.","All the people on the pier were staring down at
me open-mouthed. Dusty was still in the water

more frightening than anything: I thought, if she

angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so I
swam towards the pier but, within microseconds,
Dusty had ploughed into me with her snout. It
was very powerful and painful, and the speed
was amazing. I went hurtling forwards."
"I was at the pier but I couldnt get out because of
my injuries. I was terrified. I shouted for help and
a man put his arm in and pulled me out of the
water. Then, another man appeared and said he
was a doctor. I was so cold and very worried  I
didnt know how bad my injuries were and my
biggest fear was internal bleeding. The doctor
said he didnt think I had internal bleeding but he
thought I probably had broken bones. I found out
later that I had six spinal fractures, three broken
ribs and a damaged lung.","I was at the pier but couldnt get out because of
my injuries. I felt pure terror. I shouted for help
and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on
to the steps. Then, another man appeared and
said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. He had
been driving into Doolin when he saw what was
happening on the pier. I was so cold and very
worried  I didnt know how bad my injuries
were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding.
He checked me over and said he couldnt feel
any evidence of bleeding but that I probably
had broken bones. I found out later that I had

"I was in hospital for five days and I couldnt work
for five months. I couldnt move normally and I
was in pain. Then, doctors told me I had posttraumatic
stress. My near-death experience made
me anxious about everything. I felt that people
were looking at me in the wrong way, I began to
have problems with loud noises and I suffered
from memory loss. I could no longer work.","I was in hospital for five days and off work for

noises and I suffered from memory loss. Three
months before the accident, I had opened a
health-food shop but I had to let it go because I
could no longer work.","I was at the pier but couldnt get out because of

"It was the hardest year ever but, now, things are
better. I had therapy, osteopathy and massage. I
work as an osteopath now. I understand how the
patients feel because I have been a
patient myself.","It was the hardest year ever but, now, its all
behind me. I had therapy, osteopathy and

practice now. I have a new empathy with patients
because I have been one.","I was in hospital for five days, in a back brace

done before. I felt that people were looking at

"I am grateful that I am healthy. I really want to
prevent other people being injured. We think
dolphins are lovely and we have faith in them 
who would think a dolphin would ever attack a
person? If you see a dangerous animal coming
towards you with big teeth, its scary, but dolphins
have this lovely, wide smile.","I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to

dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.","I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to

"I dont have any anger towards Dusty. I respect
her. But I was in her territory and shes a wild,
unpredictable animal. People need to know that.
So many people come here to swim with her and
they dont understand how dangerous it can be.
Several other people were injured that summer.","I dont have any anger towards Dusty. I respect

"After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty
swam away but, then, she came back and looked
at me. Our eyes met and I felt she was sorry for
what she did to me. She was a totally different
dolphin; the anger was gone. The people on
the pier were amazed. When she had that little
moment with me, that was the end of the terror. I
forgave her.","After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty
